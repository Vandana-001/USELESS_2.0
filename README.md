## Project Description  
A fun little website that shows random cute animal picsâ€”until you hit "like" and get hit with a surprise jumpscare and creepy sound. Cute meets chaos.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
The internet is overflowing with adorable animal pictures, and people are getting way too comfortable scrolling peacefully. Whereâ€™s the suspense? Whereâ€™s the chaos? Clearly, the world has a cuteness overload problemâ€”with zero fear.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We decided to restore balance. Our website lures users in with heart-melting animal pics and captionsâ€”and just when they hit "like", BAM! A terrifying jumpscare and spooky audio greet them. Itâ€™s cute, itâ€™s cursed, and itâ€™s completely unnecessary.
